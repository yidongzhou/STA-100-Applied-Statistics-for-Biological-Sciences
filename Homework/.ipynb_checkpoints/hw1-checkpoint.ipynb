    "10. R is necessary for the remaining questions. We will be using R Studio to perform some basic data analysis. The dataset we will be exploring is the famous Edgar Anderson's Iris Data. It provides the measurements (in cm) of the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The three species are iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.\n",
    "    - The Iris Data is included in R and is called iris. Visualize the structure of the Iris Data by using the command *head()* on the iris data. Report the sepal length, petal width, and species of the 6th observation in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: The head() command displays only the ﬁrst six observations, but that does not mean there are only 6 observations in the dataset! As a reminder, you can use the print() command if you want to display all of the observations in the data.\n",

    "        - Find the ﬁve number summary for sepal length. Also calculate the IQR based on this ﬁve number summary.\n",
    "        - Plot a boxplot of sepal length. Make sure your boxplot is appropriately labeled and titled. Use this boxplot to determine if there are any outliers in the data.\n",
    "        - Plot 3 side-by-side boxplots of sepal length, split by species. Describe how the species compare to one another. Also comment on the spread of the sepal length of each species, and point out any outliers.\n",
    "        - Plot a histogram of sepal length over all species. Use the histogram to describe the skewness and modality of the sepal length data."
